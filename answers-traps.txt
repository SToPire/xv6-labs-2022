Q:Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A:a0-a7. 13 is held in register a2.

Q:Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A:Call to function f & g are both inlined.

Q:At what address is the function printf located?
A:0x630

Q:What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A:0x38, which is the address of the next instruction of jalr.

Q:Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
  What is the output?
A:"He110 World"

Q:The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A:i=0x726c6400, 57616 doesn't need to change.

Q:In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
A:y is the value that happens to be in the registed a2.
